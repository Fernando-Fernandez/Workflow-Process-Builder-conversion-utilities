USAGE:  node ./transformFileWithRegex.js sourceFile targetFile regexFile
applies regex to sourceFile and writes to targetFile
where regexFile is a text file with a regex on one line and the regex replacement on the next line
if the next line is blank, the regex is replaced with the empty string
use blank lines to separate each regex pair

EXAMPLE:  node ./transformFileWithRegex.js PBSourceXML.txt target.txt PBFlowExtractToTextRegex.txt
all regex substitutions in PBFlowExtractToTextRegex.txt will be applied to PBSourceXML.txt and 
the result written to target.txt
